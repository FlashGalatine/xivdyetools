# BUG-009: `Dye.hex` Is `string` Instead of `HexColor` Branded Type

## Severity
LOW

## Type
Type Safety Gap

## Location
- File: `packages/types/src/dye/dye.ts`
- Line(s): ~54
- Field: `hex: string`

## Description
The `Dye` interface declares `hex` as a plain `string` rather than the branded `HexColor` type. This defeats the purpose of the branded type system — every dye object's hex value is an unbranded string, and code that accepts `HexColor` parameters cannot receive `dye.hex` without a cast or re-validation.

## Evidence
```typescript
// types/src/dye/dye.ts
export interface Dye {
  /** Hex color value (#RRGGBB format) */
  hex: string;  // ← Should be HexColor
}
```

## Suggested Fix
Change to `hex: HexColor` and ensure that `DyeDatabase.initialize()` wraps each hex value through `createHexColor()`:

```typescript
export interface Dye {
  hex: HexColor;
}
```

## Why It's Hidden
TypeScript doesn't flag `string` → `HexColor` or `HexColor` → `string` flow issues unless consumers explicitly annotate their parameters as `HexColor`. Most code uses plain `string` throughout, so the gap is invisible.
