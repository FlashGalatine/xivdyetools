# OPT-001: Missing OKLAB Cache in ColorConverter

## Impact
MEDIUM

## Category
Caching

## Location
- File: `packages/core/src/services/color/ColorConverter.ts`
- Line(s): ~994-1028
- Function: `rgbToOklab()`

## Current Performance
`rgbToOklab()` performs matrix multiplication and cube roots on every call. Unlike `rgbToLab()` and `rgbToHsv()`, which have LRU caches, OKLAB conversions are uncached. Since OKLAB is the **recommended matching method** and used extensively in `DyeSearch`, this is a hot path.

## Bottleneck Analysis
Each OKLAB conversion involves:
- 3 sRGB-to-linear conversions
- 3×3 matrix multiplication (twice)
- 3 cube root operations
This is repeated for every user query × 136 candidate dyes.

## Proposed Optimization
Add an `rgbToOklabCache: LRUCache<string, OKLAB>` similar to the existing `rgbToLabCache`:

```typescript
private rgbToOklabCache = new LRUCache<string, OKLAB>(1000);

rgbToOklab(r: number, g: number, b: number): OKLAB {
  const key = `${r},${g},${b}`;
  const cached = this.rgbToOklabCache.get(key);
  if (cached) return cached;
  // ... existing calculation ...
  this.rgbToOklabCache.set(key, result);
  return result;
}
```

## Expected Improvement
Cache hit rate should be very high (~100%) for dye database lookups since the same 136 dye colors are converted repeatedly. First-request cold start only.

## Trade-offs
Minimal memory overhead (1000 entries × ~32 bytes = ~32KB).
