# What's New in Version 4.1.8

*Released: February 21, 2026*

## 🔒 Security Audit Fixes

**Stronger Login Protection**
- Fixed a rare edge case where the login flow could accept an incomplete security check — it now properly rejects the request if any verification step is missing
- This was found during a comprehensive security audit; no evidence it was ever exploited

## 🛠️ Under-the-Hood Improvements

**Dye Matching is Faster**
- Color matching calculations are now cached, so finding your closest dye match is snappier — especially noticeable if you're comparing lots of colors in a session

**SVG Card Improvements**
- Fixed a display issue where Japanese, Korean, and Chinese dye category labels could appear clipped or incorrectly sized on dye info cards
- Special characters like `&` in dye names no longer appear garbled (e.g., `&amp;amp;`) on generated cards

**Code Quality**
- Fixed all linting warnings and auto-formatted the entire codebase
- No visible changes to users — just cleaner, more maintainable code
