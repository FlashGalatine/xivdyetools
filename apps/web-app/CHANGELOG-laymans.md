# What's New in Version 4.1.7

*Released: February 19, 2026*

---

## 🔒 Session & Security Improvements

**Logging Out is Now More Thorough**
- When you log out, any cached market board price data is now cleared too
- This matters if you share a device — the next person won't see your leftover data

**Multi-Tab Session Sync**
- If you have XIV Dye Tools open in multiple browser tabs, logging out in one tab now logs you out in all of them
- Logging in on one tab also syncs your session to any other tabs you already have open
- No more "ghost sessions" in forgotten tabs

## ⚡ Behind-the-Scenes Improvements

**Code Quality Sweep**
- Fixed all linting warnings and errors across the web app
- No visible changes to users — just cleaner, stricter code under the hood
